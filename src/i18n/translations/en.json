        "a": "Your deposit is collected in March and goes directly toward purchasing our chicks and feed. Once we've ordered birds for you, those costs are committed. We keep our operation lean—no middlemen, no waste."
      },
      {
        "q": "How much will my final order cost?",
        "a": "Our chickens are priced by the pound. A typical bird weighs 5-7 lbs dressed. With a 10-bird minimum, expect a total between $350-$490. Your $100 deposit is credited toward this balance."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I visit the farm?",
        "a": "Absolutely. We encourage Founding Families to visit during the season. You'll see exactly how your food is raised. Just reach out to schedule a time."
      },
      {
        "q": "What if I can't pick up on Harvest Day?",
        "a": "Contact us to arrange an alternate time. If we don't hear from you within 7 days, your birds will be donated to a local food bank and your deposit forfeited."
      },
      {
        "q": "Are your chickens organic?",
        "a": "We follow organic principles but are not certified. Our birds eat non-GMO feed, forage on pasture daily, and receive no antibiotics. Certification is expensive—we'd rather keep your food affordable."
      },
      {
        "q": "What's special about pasture-raised chicken?",
        "a": "Pasture-raised birds have more omega-3s, more vitamins A and E, and dramatically better flavor. The difference is visible—our birds have golden, firm fat from sunshine and varied diet."
      },
      {
        "q": "What do the chickens look like when I receive them?",
        "a": "Your birds arrive whole, vacuum-sealed, and flash-frozen. They're fully dressed (cleaned, no head or feet) just like store-bought—but with incomparably better flavor and nutrition."

    "p1": "We live in an era where the cost of digital fabrication is approaching zero. In a world drowning in \"synthetic noise\"—a flood of cheap, automated content designed to capture attention but starve the soul—words, images, and connection are being mass-produced by machines that do not breathe, bleed, or believe.",
    "p2": "Against this rising tide, we draw a line in the soil. We acknowledge a hard, biological truth: AI cannot lay an egg. AI cannot heal a pasture. AI cannot shake a customer's hand at the farm gate. Technology can simulate reality, but it cannot sustain life; it can write a poem about a sunrise, but it cannot turn sunlight into protein. The digital world is merely a map; the farm is the territory. We choose to live in the territory.",
    "p3": "As the digital realm becomes infinite and cheap, the physical world becomes finite and precious. Verified Reality—real food, real land, real people—is the ultimate luxury asset. When everything on a screen can be faked, the only currency that holds value is what you can touch, taste, and verify with your own eyes. We do not sell commodities; we sell the antidote to the artificial.",
    "p4": "This does not make us Luddites; it makes us Architects. We view technology not as a master, but as a servant to the land. We are building a \"Holy Island\" to insulate our family from cultural drift, placing a firewall between the chaos of the screen and the peace of the soil. We use the tools of the present to protect the values of the past.",
    "p5": "This is the soil in which we raise our children—not by algorithms, but by the seasons. They will know that food does not come from a printer, but from stewardship. They will learn that you cannot \"hack\" a harvest; you must earn it. In a world of instant gratification, we choose the long, hard road of regeneration.",
