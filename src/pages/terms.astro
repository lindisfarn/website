          Welcome to Lindisfarn. By joining as a Founding Family, you're entering a partnership with us. This agreement outlines how that partnership works—clearly and fairly.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-['Cormorant_Garamond',serif] text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#2B2B2B] mt-10 mb-4">
          1. The Deposit
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          To reserve your spot, we require a <strong>$100 deposit</strong> per membership. This deposit is collected in March and is <strong>non-refundable</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Why non-refundable? Your deposit goes directly toward purchasing chicks and feed at the start of the season. Once we've ordered birds for you, those costs are committed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Your deposit will be credited toward your final order total at pickup.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-['Cormorant_Garamond',serif] text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#2B2B2B] mt-10 mb-4">
          2. Pricing & Payment
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          The final cost will be calculated based on the actual dressed weight of your birds at the season's current posted price per pound. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Here's how it works:</strong>
        </p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>You reserve a minimum of 10 birds</li>
          <li>Birds are weighed after processing</li>
          <li>Your total is calculated (weight × price per pound)</li>
          <li>Your $100 deposit is subtracted</li>
          <li>The remaining balance is due at pickup</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          We accept payment via e-transfer or credit card (processed through Stripe).
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-['Cormorant_Garamond',serif] text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#2B2B2B] mt-10 mb-4">
          3. Pickup Policy
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          Pickup occurs on <strong>Harvest Day</strong> in late September at our farm in Glen Robertson, Ontario. You will receive an email to schedule your pickup time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Please note:</strong> Your birds are flash-frozen and packaged specifically for you. We cannot hold them indefinitely.
        </p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>If you cannot make your scheduled time, contact us to reschedule</li>
          <li>If we do not hear from you within <strong>7 days</strong> of Harvest Day ("No Show"), your meat will be donated to a local food bank and your deposit will be forfeited</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          We understand life happens—just communicate with us and we'll work something out.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-['Cormorant_Garamond',serif] text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#2B2B2B] mt-10 mb-4">
          4. Farm Visits & Liability
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          Lindisfarn is a <strong>working farm</strong>. If you visit for pickup or a farm tour, please be aware:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>We have <strong>electric fencing</strong> to protect our birds from predators</li>
          <li>The ground may be uneven, muddy, or slippery</li>
          <li>Farm equipment and animals are present</li>
          <li>Children must be supervised at all times</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          By visiting our farm, you acknowledge these risks and agree to take reasonable precautions. You also agree to supervise any children in your care.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-['Cormorant_Garamond',serif] text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#2B2B2B] mt-10 mb-4">
          5. Product Quality
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          We raise our birds with care and use a licensed butcher for processing. Your chicken arrives vacuum-sealed and flash-frozen.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          While we take every precaution, farming involves variables we cannot fully control (weather, natural variation in growth, etc.). We cannot guarantee exact bird weights or quantities, but we will always communicate openly with you.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-['Cormorant_Garamond',serif] text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#2B2B2B] mt-10 mb-4">
          6. Changes & Cancellations
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          <strong>By You:</strong> If you need to cancel before we place our chick order (typically early March), please contact us immediately. After chicks are ordered, your deposit cannot be refunded.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>By Us:</strong> In the unlikely event we cannot fulfill your order (natural disaster, flock loss, etc.), we will refund your full deposit and notify you as soon as possible.
        </p>

          7. Governing Law
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          This agreement is governed by the laws of the <strong>Province of Ontario, Canada</strong>. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of Ontario.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-['Cormorant_Garamond',serif] text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#2B2B2B] mt-10 mb-4">
